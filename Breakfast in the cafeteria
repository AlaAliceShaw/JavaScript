question
The 30-storey building has two cafeterias located on floors n and m.
The cafeteria on floor n is called "Nonstop", the cafeteria on floor m is called "Merci".
You work on floor x and want to have breakfast at the nearest cafeteria. Which cafe will you go to?
Write a function named nearestCafe that takes three different numbers x, n, m as arguments
(x is the floor where you are; n, m are the floors where the cafeterias are located) and returns the name of the nearest cafeteria. 
If the number of floors to the cafeterias is the same, you prefer to have breakfast in the "Merci" cafe.

solution:

function nearestCafe(x, n, m){
  if(Math.abs(n-x)< Math.abs(m-x)) return "Nonstop";
  else return "Merci";
}
