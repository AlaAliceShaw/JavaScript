question
Write a function named fillArray that takes the numbers n (n> = 1) and x (1 <= x <= n) as arguments 
and returns an array of integers between 1 and n, inclusive, excluding x.
You must use the continue statement in your solution.
Examples:
fillArray (5, 2) should return [1, 3, 4, 5]; // numbers from 1 to 5, excluding number 2.
fillArray (10, 5) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; // numbers from 1 to 10, excluding 5.

solution:

function fillArray(n, x){
let arr =[];
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    if( i === x){
    continue;
    }else{
    arr.push(i)
    }
  }
return arr;
}
