question
Write a function called upsideDown that takes n as an argument and returns an n-string triangle of asterisks (*). 
The first line contains n stars, the second contains (n-1) asterisk, ..., the last line contains 1 asterisk.
All lines except the last one end with a \ n newline character.
For example, for n = 5, the line should be:
"***** \ n **** \ n *** \ n ** \ n *"
When outputting to the console, this line is displayed as an "inverted triangle":

solution:

function upsideDown(n){
let str ='';
    for(let i = n; i >= 1; i--){
     str += '*'.repeat(i)+ '\n';
    }
    return str.slice(0,-1);
 }
