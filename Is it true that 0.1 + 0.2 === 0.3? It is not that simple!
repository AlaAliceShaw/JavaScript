question
Write a function isSumEqualsNumber that takes three fractional numbers a, b, c as arguments and checks
if the sum of the two fractional numbers equals the third fractional number, i.e. is the sum of a and b equal to c.

The function must return true (if the sum of the numbers after rounding is equal to the third number) or false otherwise.

Comment. Round the sum of the numbers and the third number to two decimal places using the toFixed (n) method.


solution:

function isSumEqualsNumber(a, b, c){
let sum = a + b;
  if(sum.toFixed(2) === c.toFixed(2)) return true;
    else
  return false;
}
