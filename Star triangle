question
Write a function called starTriangle that takes n as an argument and returns a triangle of n strings consisting of asterisks (*).
All lines except the last one end with a \ n newline character.
For example, for n = 7, the line should be:
"* \ n ** \ n *** \ n **** \ n ***** \ n ****** \ n *******"
When outputting to the console, such a line is displayed as a "triangle":

solution:

function starTriangle(n){
let str ='';
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
  str += '*'.repeat(i) + '\n';
  }
  return str.slice(0,-1);
}
