Find the sum of all positive two-digit integers.
Write a function called sumOfTwoDigitsNumbers that returns the sum of numbers between 10 and 99,
inclusive. Use a do while loop in your solution.


solution:
function sumOfTwoDigitsNumbers(){
let x = 10;
 let sum = 0;
 do {
  sum += x;
  x++;
 } while (x <= 99);
 return sum;
 }
