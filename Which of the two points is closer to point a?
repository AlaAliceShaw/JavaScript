question
Three points a, b, c with different coordinates lie on the number axis. Determine which of the two points: b or c is closer to point a.
threePoints
Write a function named nearestPoint that takes three numbers a, b, c (coordinates of three points on the number axis)
as arguments and returns:

string "b" if point b is closer to point a,
string "c", if point c is closer to point a,
the string "distances are equal" if the distances from points b and c to point a are equal


solution:

function nearestPoint(a, b, c){
if(Math.abs(b-a)=== Math.abs(c-a)) return "distances are equal";
else if(Math.abs(b-a)< Math.abs(a-c)) return "b";
else if(Math.abs(a-c)< Math.abs(a-b))return "c";
else if(a===b || a ===c )
return undefined;
}
